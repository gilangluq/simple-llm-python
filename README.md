# Simple LLM in Python

## Overview
This project provides a framework for creating and using a Large Language Model (LLM) agent in Python. The LLM agent can process and generate natural language, making it useful for a wide variety of tasks such as answering questions, conducting conversations, performing text analysis, and more.

With this Python-based implementation, you can easily integrate LLM capabilities into your applications, enhancing them with powerful natural language understanding and generation.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Easily process human language, answer questions, summarize content, and more.
- **Flexible Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the LLM agent into Python applications.
- **Modular Architecture**: Customizable framework for extending the LLM's functionality.
- **Interactive Conversations**: Handle multi-turn dialogues with context awareness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
